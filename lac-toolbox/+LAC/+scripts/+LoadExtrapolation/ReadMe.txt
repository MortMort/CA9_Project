Running the load extrapolation process:
- Run LAC.scripts.LoadExtrapolation and select the destination folder for the load extrapolation process
- The files "LoadExtrapolation_init.m" and the "LoadExtrapolation_mainfunc" will be copied in this folder and LoadExtrapolation_init.m will open
- The "LoadExtrapolationLoadExtremes.m" and "LoadExtrapolationScript.m" needs to stay in the LaC toolbox extrapolation folder 
(called as LAC.scripts.LoadExtrapolation.LoadExtrapolationLoadExtremes and LAC.scripts.LoadExtrapolation.LoadExtrapolationScript in the mainfunc file)

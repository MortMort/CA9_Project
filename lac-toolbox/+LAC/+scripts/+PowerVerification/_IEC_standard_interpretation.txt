On IEC standard 61400-12-2 interpretation:

-	AEP based on measurements and simulations is considered 0 for the wind speed bins outside the dataset which fullfills IEC standard
- 	To follow the standard, dataset needs to
		- have a minimum of 30 min sampled data for each wind bin -> 3 time series (incomplete bins are referred as the wind speed bins which include less than 3 measurements.)
		- include at least 180h of measurement
		- cover cut-in wind speed and 1.5* wind speed at 85% of the power rated (1.5*WSP(85%Prat))
		(If the later requirement is not fullfilled, AEP is still calculated. If the calculated AEP is more than 95% of AEP extrapolated, dataset is accepted.)
- 	For a calculation of Measured/Simulated AEP, values for the bins beyond the acceptable dataset are set to zero
- 	AEP extrapolated is computed in two ways: (1) AEP extrapolated - according to IEC standard, for incomplete bins up to the cut-out wind speed, power is taken as a constant value equal to the last complete bins;
	(2) AEP extrapolated Pref - for the incomplete bins up to the cut-out wind speed, power is taken from the reference power curve (this might be more correct due to derating of the turbine).
- 	If there is a single incomplete bin below or equal to1.5* wind speed at 85% of the power rated (except for the cut-in wind speed), this bin is interpolated from the values of the adjacent bins
	and the dataset is accepted.

User has an option to set FlagInterpolAll=1 in the main srcipt (PowerPerformance_Mainscript.m) if he wants to force interpolation of the incomplete bins (across the whole dataset excluding the incomplete bins at the end of the dataset).
In case of single incomplete bin below or equal to 1.5*WSP(85%Prat) (if NOT cut-in wind speed), this bin will automatically be interpolated even if the interpolation flags are deactivated.
If FlagInterpolAll is deactivated and dataset includes >1 incomplete bin below 1.5*WSP(85%Prat), user will be asked whether he wants to force interpolation of these bins below 1.5*WSP(85%Prat).
If there are three and more incomplete bins in a row, values for those bins will noy be interpolated even if the interpolation is forced by the user.
